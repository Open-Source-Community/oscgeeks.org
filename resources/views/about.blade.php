                Computer and Information Science - Ain Shams University, on Dec 5th
                2013.<br> Open Source Community promotes the philosophy of free software
                and provides a suitable environment for students to create open source
                projects.<br>
                We believe that knowledge and technologies do not belong to a person or a
                group of people.<br> We believe that knowledge and technologies must be
                open and available for everybody to study, contribute in, modify and share.<br>
                Simply we are students who believe in the Open Source concept. We are a
                community because we work together in each committee to reach our goal.
                A person is not just a member in a committee like PR or HR, we work
                wherever we can because we are OSCians. In other words <span>“ open sourceاحنا بتوع الـ ”</span></p>
