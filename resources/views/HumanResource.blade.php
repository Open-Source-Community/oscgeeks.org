            <h2>Job Description:</h2>
            <p>It's not only about interviews, WE ARE THE GOVERNMENT! We believe in
                human resources and how important it is to invest in, we also believe in order
                and the importance of applying it, so, what does an HR do in OSC ?
                Our cycle begins with the interviews, where the interviewee is always a
                winner; meaning that it's not only about the selection, it's about
                knowing ourselves better and discovering our advantages to improve them
                and disadvantages to work on.</p>

            <p>Then comes motivation. We all fall sometimes, but OSC's HR are always
                there to bring us back up and keep us focused on our greater good and
                belief. We help the crew as well as ourselves to keep any negative
                feelings or problems from hindering our progress. We believe that what
                makes communities rise or fall are the people and how well their
                potentials are used, and we intend to keep everyone in a shared
                productive spirit that will reassure us that our community keeps on growing.
                Another very important aspect of the HR is evaluation. The HRs are the
                guardians that always follow you and let you know yourself even better.
                This is done by evaluating each person's and committee's progress to make
                sure that we are always improving and going up on that curve!
            </p>

            <p>Last but not the least, the HR is also responsible for organizing. Like
                we said before, we have a thing for order. We partner with others and
                help organizing our events and making sure everything is on track.
                We are the watchful eyes over the community; the guardians behind the
                scenes. We are the HR!</p>
